### Skill and Support Gem Interaction

Arcane Cloak can be supported by these support gems but it doesn't actually mean that they make sense together.

| Icon | Support Gem | Skill Interaction | Recommended |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| ![img](https://web.poecdn.com/image/Art/2DItems/Gems/IntelligenceSupport.png) | Arcane Surge Support | Due to `Spends (45-64)% of current Mana` on Arcane Cloak you want your Mana back as fast as possible. Arcane Cloak will trigger Arcane Surge at any skill level and increase your mana regeneration. It will also increase your damage for 4 seconds \(unmodified\). | ✓ |
| ![img](https://web.poecdn.com/image/Art/2DItems/Gems/DexteritySupport.png) | Awakened Swift Affliction Support | `25% reduced Duration of Supported Skills and Damaging Ailments they inflict` will make the base duration of the buff shorter which in return means that the cooldown time will happen more frequently. | ✗ |
| ![img](https://web.poecdn.com/image/Art/2DItems/Gems/DexteritySupport.png) | Cast on Death Support | Cast Arcane Cloak when you die. Doesn't really make sense because you want to use Arcane Cloak to actually prevent death. | ✗ |
| ![img](https://web.poecdn.com/image/Art/2DItems/Gems/StrengthSupport.png) | Cast when Damage Taken Support | The combination sounds good in theory. But to support a high level Arcane Cloak you also need a high level Cast when Damage Taken Support. Which means you need to take at least 2000 Damage to trigger it and you can't cast it yourself. This will guarantee a low uptime but you want a near permanent uptime. | ✗ |
| ![img](https://web.poecdn.com/image/Art/2DItems/Gems/IntelligenceSupport.png) | Cast when Stunned Support | Will trigger on Stun and only on Stun. Same as with Cast when Damage Taken Support the uptime will be far too low and not worth it. | ✗ |
| ![img](https://web.poecdn.com/image/Art/2DItems/Gems/IntelligenceSupport.png) | Efficacy Support | `Supported Skills have (10–16)% increased Skill Effect Duration` will make the buffs last longer. Additionally, if the gem has the Anomalous prefix, the quality will further increase the Skill Effect Duration as it grants `Supported Skills have (0–10)% increased Skill Effect Duration`. | ✓ |
| ![img](https://web.poecdn.com/image/Art/2DItems/Gems/StrengthSupport.png) | Increased Duration Support | Increased duration of the `75% of Damage from Hits is taken from Buff before your Life or Energy Shield buff` and `Buff grants Added Lightning Damage equal to (10-14)% of Mana Spent by this Skill's effect` buffs. What's there not to like? | ✓ |
| ![img](https://web.poecdn.com/image/Art/2DItems/Gems/StrengthSupport.png) | Less Duration Support | Some niché builds might use this but in general you want an increased duration of the buff. | ✗ |
| ![img](https://web.poecdn.com/image/Art/2DItems/Gems/DexteritySupport.png) | Second Wind Support | `Supported Skills have (5–24)% increased Cooldown Recovery Rate` will make the cooldown time shorter. | ✓ |
| ![img](https://web.poecdn.com/image/Art/2DItems/Gems/DexteritySupport.png) | Swift Affliction Support | `15% reduced Duration of Supported Skills and Damaging Ailments they inflict` will make the base duration of the buff shorter which in return means that the cooldown time will happen more frequently. | ✗ |
